# Web Scraping Project with Python AIOHttp

I created this simple project to practice what I learned from this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUwZ9rS0SeM&t=623s) using AIOHttp Python library the enables us to create http request asynchronously that reduces a lot the amount of time needed to perform this process, letting us create faster and more efficient web scrapers.

I used [ludonauta](https://www.ludonauta.es/juegos-mesas-tiendas/listar-por-tienda/dracotienda/page:1) website to get details from products available on their website.
